    "Once a job is in queue, the schedd will try its best to execute it to completion. There are several cases where a user may want to interrupt the normal flow of jobs. Perhaps the results are no longer needed; perhaps the job needs to be edited to correct a submission error. These actions fall under the purview of _job management_.\n",

    "* `edit()`: Change an attribute for a set of jobs to a given expression. If invoked within a transaction, multiple calls to `edit` are visible atomically.\n",
    "   * The set of jobs to change can be given as a ClassAd expression. If no jobs match the filter, _then an exception is thrown_.\n",
    "* `act()`: Change the state of a job to a given state (remove, hold, suspend, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods take a _job specification_: either a ClassAd expression (such as `Owner =?= \"janedoe\"`)\n",
    "or a list of job IDs (such as `[\"1.1\", \"2.2\", \"2.3\"]`).\n",
    "The `act` method takes an argument from the `JobAction` enum.\n",
    "The commonly-used values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Hold`: put a job on hold, vacating a running job if necessary.  A job will stay in the hold\n",
    "   state until explicitly acted upon by the admin or owner.\n",
    "* `Release`: Release a job from the hold state, returning it to Idle.\n",
    "* `Remove`: Remove a job from the Schedd's queue, cleaning it up first on the remote host (if running).\n",
    "   This requires the remote host to acknowledge it has successfully vacated the job, meaning ``Remove`` may\n",
    "   not be instantaneous.\n",
    "* `Vacate`: Cause a running job to be killed on the remote resource and return to idle state.  With\n",
